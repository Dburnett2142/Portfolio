            <p>The <a href="https://www.weber.edu/wildcat-microfund/default.html" target="_blank">Wildcat Microfund</a> is an initiative designed to support entrepreneurs through guidance, networking, and financial assistance. It's a platform that encourages innovation and helps turn ideas into reality, empowering individuals and strengthening communities.</p>

            <h2>My Contribution</h2>
            <p>From October 2023 to May 2024, I had the opportunity to contribute to this inspiring project as a chiefly back-end programmer. My role involved tackling weekly tasks, implementing new features, and continuously improving the platform's functionality and user experience.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Language Translation Features:</strong> Implemented multi-language support to make the platform accessible to a broader audience.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Forms:</strong> Developed dynamic forms that adapt to user input, enhancing the user interaction and data collection process.</li>
                <li><strong>Error-Tracking Pages:</strong> Created pages to track and display errors, significantly improving the platform's reliability and maintainability.</li>
                <li><strong>Bug Fixes:</strong> Regularly identified and fixed bugs, ensuring a smooth, error-free user experience.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Working on the Wildcat Microfund project was a rewarding experience that not only allowed me to enhance my technical skills but also contribute to a cause that has a real impact on people's lives.</p>
